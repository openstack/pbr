upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated support for ``setup.py test`` has been removed.
    This feature has been deprecated since version 4.0. The two test tools
    supported, ``nose`` and ``testr``, are no longer maintained, and the
    general concept of distutils commands is itself deprecated.
    Users should switch to running the test runners directly and ideally
    migrate to an alternative, supported test runner like ``stestr`` or
    ``pytest``.
