    The deprecated support for `setup.py build_sphinx` has been removed.
    This feature has been deprecated since version 4.2. Setuptools and
    sphinx have removed support for this command which breaks PBR's ability
    to integrate with those two tools to provide this functionality.
    Users should switch to building sphinx docs with sphinx directly.
