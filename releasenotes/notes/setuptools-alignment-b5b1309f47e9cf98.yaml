deprecations:
  - |
    A number of pbr-specific `setup.cfg` sections and options have been
    deprecated in order in favour of setuptools native `setup.cfg` sections
    and options or their `pyproject.toml` equivalents:

    - The `[entry_points]` section has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[options.entry_points]` section (if using `setup.cfg`) or the
      `[project.scripts]` and/or `[project.entry-points.{name}]` sections
      (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[files] packages_root` option has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[options] package_dir` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the
      `[tools.setuptools] package_dir` option (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[files] packages` option has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[options] packages` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the
      `[tools.setuptools] packages` option (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[files] package_data` option has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[options.package_data]` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the
      `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` option (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[files] namespace_packages` option has been deprecated in favour of
      the `[options] namespace_packages` option (if using `setup.cfg`).
      Alternatively, migrate to PEP 420-style namespace packages

    - The `[files] data_files` option has been deprecated, and support for
      non-package data files in general is deprecated in setuptools and their
      use is discouraged. For package data files, use `[options] package_data`
      (if using `setup.cfg`) or `[tools.setuptools] package_data` (if using
      `pyproject.toml`) instead. If non-package data files are necessary, use
      `[options] data_files` (if using `setup.cfg`) or `[tools.setuptools]
      data-files` (if using `pyproject.toml`) instead.

    - The `[files] scripts` option has been deprecated. There is no direct
      replacement. Instead, migrate to using the `console_scripts` entrypoint
      and use the `[options.entry_points]` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or
      the `[project.scripts]` option (if using `pyproject.toml`).

    - The `[files] modules` option has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[options] py_modules` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the
      `[tools.setuptools] py-modules` option (if using `pyproject.toml`)

      `[metadata] url` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the `[project.urls]`
      option (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[metadata] summary` option has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[metadata] description` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the `[project]
      description` option (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[metadata] classifier` option has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[metadata] classifiers` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the `[project]
      classifiers` option (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[metadata] platform` option has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[metadata] platforms` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the
      `[tool.setuptools] platforms` (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[metadata] requires_dist` option has been deprecated in favour of
      the `[options] install_requires` option (if using `setup.cfg`) or the

      `[project] requires-python` option (if using `pyproject.toml`)

    - The `[metadata] provides_dist` option has been deprecated as it is
      obsolete and is no longer used by pip

    - The `[metadata] provides_extra` option has been deprecated as it is
      obsolete and is no longer used by pip
