deprecations:
  - |
    A number of pbr-specific `setup.cfg` sections and options have been
    deprecated in order in favour of setuptools native `setup.cfg` sections
    and options or their `pyproject.toml` equivalents:

    - The `entry_points` section has been deprecated in favour of the
      `[options.entry_points]` section (if using `setup.cfg`) or the
      `[project.scripts]` and/or `[project.entry-points.{name}]` sections
      (if using `pyproject.toml`)
